recipeingredient:
- "of   1 package Cookies Keebler   Simply   Shortbread"
- "1   1 Butter stick"
- " Canola   spray"
- "5   5 Cream Cheese pkgs"
- "1.25 Cups Sugar"
- "4 Eggs Large"
- "1 Tablespoon Self Rising Flour"
- "1.5 Teaspoons Almond Extract"
- "0.75 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
- "16 Ounces Sour Cream"
- "0.25 Cup Sugar"
- "1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large metal casserole dish full of water. Carefully place the dish on the bottom rack of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350."
- "Place the ENTIRE PACKAGE of Keebler™ Simply Shortbread Cookies into a gallon Ziplock™ bag. Crush the cookies in the bag. Scoop the cookie crumbs into a stainless steel bowl. Melt the stick of butter and pour it over the cookies. Blend well with a fork."
- "Spray an 11 inch spring-form pan with Canola spray. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with the cookie mixture."
- "Cut the cream cheese into eights as each package is opened. Add 1st package of eights and blend for 30 seconds. I use a food processor to accomplish this, but a mixer should do. Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl after each blend."
- "Blend in the four remaining cream cheese packages. Add the sugar and blend for 1 minute. Add eggs and mix 30 seconds more. After the cream cheese, sugar, and eggs are thoroughly mixed together, add the flour and extracts then blend for a final 30 seconds."
- "Pour the mixture into the prepared spring-form pan and bake for 45 minutes at 350 with the spring-form pan sitting on the middle oven rack above the &#34;water bath&#34;."
- "Check to see if outer rim of cake is burning and cover with a &#34;donut&#34; of aluminum foil if necessary. Bake for 15 minutes more. While baking, mix the topping ingredients together."
- "At 1 hour total baking time, remove cake from oven and spread the topping evenly across including the edges of the crust. Bake for 5 minutes more."
- "Let cake cool for 1 hour before slicing or placing in the refrigerator, covering with aluminum. This cheesecake, like many other cakes, tastes best when it is warm - fresh from the oven."
- "Try slicing this cheesecake, like ALL cheesecakes, with unwaxed dental floss. Pushing it down through the crust is slow, but every slice will come out perfect."
