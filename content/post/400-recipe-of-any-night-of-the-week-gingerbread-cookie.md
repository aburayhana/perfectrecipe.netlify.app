If those flavors are wrong…I don&#39;t wanna be right. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you? These tender cookies are the perfect fix for that craving, combining the classic spice flavors we all love and a chewy crumb that just about melts in your mouth. To her recipe, I add a little more molasses and increase the amount of spice favors (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and allspice). Because of the added sticky sweetener (molasses), I add a little more flour to help soak it all up.
