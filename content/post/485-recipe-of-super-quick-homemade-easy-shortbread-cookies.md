recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Powdered sugar"
- "100 grams Butter or margarine"
- "150 grams Allpurpose flour or cake flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add powdered sugar to the softened butter (I microwave it for 20 seconds to soften) and mix well with a whisk. If using unsalted butter, add a pinch of salt."
- "Add flour (no sifting needed) and mix with the whisk. Knead the mixture until it&#39;s no longer floury. Don&#39;t worry if it is rough and crumbly at first, it will be smooth shortly."
- "Tear the dough, flatten each piece to a 1cm thickness and place on a baking pan. Poke holes with a fork. The dough will increase to 1.5 times its original size."
- "Bake in a 355F/180C oven for 10 minutes, then flip the baking tray around and bake for a further 3 minutes (adjust the cooking time accordingly) to bake evenly. Pay attention to the color on the edges."
- "No matter how long you have been baking them, take the cookies out of the oven once they become light brown on the edges. Cool on the baking pan (they will continue to cook from the residual heat), and they are done."
- "Here, I shaped the dough into a square log in plastic film and sliced it to make them like English style shortbread cookies. The dough can be cut with a knife easily even at room temperature. It is very easy to handle, so it&#39;s great to make cut-out cookies."
- "They are also delicious with chocolate chips added to the dough. Add the same amount as the sugar. Try them also with cocoa or coffee."
