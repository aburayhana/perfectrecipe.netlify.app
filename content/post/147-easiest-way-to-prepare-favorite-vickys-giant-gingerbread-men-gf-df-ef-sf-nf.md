- "I made a centre line 12.5 inches tall and divided it into 4 sections. The head section is 3.5 inches long and the other 3 are all 3 inches. I made the hands tip to tip 9 inches apart so from the centre line to the end of each hand is 4.5 inches. I used a coffee mug as a guide to draw the hands and feet circles and eyeballed the rest. You could perhaps print my pic and blow it up to trace it"
- "Cream together the butter and sugar, good exercise for the kids lol"
- "Mix in the golden syrup (you can use 40g corn syrup plus 20g treacle if you can&#39;t get or don&#39;t have time to make golden syrup but the flavour will be a lot flatter so you&#39;ll need to add extra spice to compensate)  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/334096-vickys-homemade-golden-syrup-like-tate-lyles-gf-df-ef-sf-nf"

- "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to gas 5 / 190C / 375°F"
- "Slide the dough with parchment still underneath off of the baking sheet and put on top of a cutting board. Take the top layer of parchment paper off. Put the template you cut out over the chilled dough. Cut around it with a sharp knife, removing the excess. Set that aside for later, you can re-roll it and cut smaller cookies from it, just bake for 6 minutes at the same temperature or freeze it for another day"
