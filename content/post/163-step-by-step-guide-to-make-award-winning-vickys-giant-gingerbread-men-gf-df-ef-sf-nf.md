recipeingredient:
- "80 grams soft brown sugar"
- "100 grams sunflower spread  softened butter"
- "60 grams golden syrup"
- "225 grams plain  gluten free flour blend"
- "1/4 tsp xanthan gum if using a glutenfree flour blend"
- "1 1/2 tsp ground ginger"

- "1/2 tsp ground nutmeg or mixed spice"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use my size guide picture below to draw a gingerbread man shape on a piece of parchment paper. Cut it out and set aside........"
- "I made a centre line 12.5 inches tall and divided it into 4 sections. The head section is 3.5 inches long and the other 3 are all 3 inches. I made the hands tip to tip 9 inches apart so from the centre line to the end of each hand is 4.5 inches. I used a coffee mug as a guide to draw the hands and feet circles and eyeballed the rest. You could perhaps print my pic and blow it up to trace it"
- "Cream together the butter and sugar, good exercise for the kids lol"
- "Mix in the golden syrup (you can use 40g corn syrup plus 20g treacle if you can&#39;t get or don&#39;t have time to make golden syrup but the flavour will be a lot flatter so you&#39;ll need to add extra spice to compensate)  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/334096-vickys-homemade-golden-syrup-like-tate-lyles-gf-df-ef-sf-nf"
- "Mix the xanthan gum and baking powder into the flour then add the flour and spices to the creamed mixture"
- "Form a soft dough. If using a gluten free flour blend you may need extra flour, just add more accordingly. You may also like to add a half tsp vanilla extract"
- "Knead it smooth then put the dough on top of a sheet of parchment paper and start to pat it out into an oval or rectangular shape"
- "Place another sheet of parchment paper on top then roll out so it&#39;s 1cm thick. It should be a little bit bigger than the 12.5&#34;x 9&#34; gingerbread man template"
- "Slide the parchment paper and dough onto a baking sheet and chill flat in the fridge for 30 minutes"
- "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to gas 5 / 190C / 375°F"
- "Slide the dough with parchment still underneath off of the baking sheet and put on top of a cutting board. Take the top layer of parchment paper off. Put the template you cut out over the chilled dough. Cut around it with a sharp knife, removing the excess. Set that aside for later, you can re-roll it and cut smaller cookies from it, just bake for 6 minutes at the same temperature or freeze it for another day"
- "Move the gingerbread man back to the baking sheet using the parchment underneath to lift it and line the sheet at the same time"
- "Bake for 15 minutes then let cool completely on the baking sheet"
- "When cooled, decorate as you like with piped icing, sweets, raisins, chocolate chips etc"
- "To give as a gift, cut another template out of card to use as a backing board so the cookie can be supported and carried easily and place in a large cellophane bag tied with a festive bow"
- "This recipe makes 1 giant gingerbread man with enough dough left over for 2 normal sized ones"
- "You can make a big reindeer or snowman like these in the recipe linked below that I did last year, with a small amendment to the template - leave off the santa hat lol  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/339451-vickys-gingerbread-snowmen-reindeer-decorating-idea"
