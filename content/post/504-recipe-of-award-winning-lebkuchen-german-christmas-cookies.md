recipeingredient:
- "120 g hazelnuts"
- "120 g hazelnut powder or almond powder"
- "25 g walnuts"
- "50 g candied orange peel"
- "50 g candied lemon peel"
- "10 g candied ginger"
- "1/2 orange  use the zest"
- "1/2 lemon  use the zest"
- "20 g lebkuchen spice mix"
- "1/2 vanilla bean scrap out the beans"
- "50 g flour"
- " "
- "3 eggs 180 g"
- "235 g powdered sugar"
- " "
- "16 oblaten wafers if you cant find them try using thin crackers or cookies"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the nuts, spices, citrus peel, vanilla and flour (every except for eggs and sugar and wafers) into a bowl."
- "Working in batches, grind the mixture into a rough meal using a food processor. Don&#39;t make it into a powder - leave some graininess so the cookies will have a good texture."
- "In a metal bowl, beat the eggs and powdered sugar together until all the white powder disappears. Heat some water in a big frying pan or pot on the stove, place the egg mixture bowl in the hot water and heat it until it&#39;s 40-43°C (you need to make it hot so it brings out the stickiness in the eggs)."
- "Transfer to a mixer or use a beater, and beat the egg mix on low medium speed until it thickens up and turns a little white (You probably have to reheat the eggs at least one time). Beating them to this consistency will give your cookies a wonderful sticky texture!"
- "Add the spice and nut mixture to the egg mixture and gently mix. Cover and let rest for one hour - this will help the mixture thicken up more."
- "After one hour, it&#39;s time to put the &#39;dough&#39; on the oblaten! One good way to do this is place a wine glass on the table upside down, put an oblaten wafer on the bottom of the glass and use it as a stand to work on."
- "Using a dough scraper card, scoop up a big dollop of the lebkuchen dough and gently scrap it onto the oblaten wafer (scoop up more than you need so you have enough to work with)"
- "While rotating the glass around, gently scrap the dough from the center to the sides - try to leave the center as high as possible like you are trying to form a pyramid. The middle should be nice and thick or else you&#39;ll end up with flat lebkuchen."
- "Place the finished lebkuchen on a baking sheet one by one."
- "Bake for 15 minutes at 200°C/400°F"
- "Remove from oven. For the sugar coating: brush half of the cookies with thick sugar water/syrup immediately. After the syrup dries, it will give the cookies a nice white frosted look."
- "For the chocolate covered ones, you have to wait until they dry completely to do the chocolate. When cooled, melt chocolate in a double boiler (Put chocolate in a small metal bowl, heat a pan of water and place the bowl on the hot water until chocolate melts)"
- "Brush over lebkuchen and decorate with almond slivers if you like. Let chocolate dry completely. All done!"
